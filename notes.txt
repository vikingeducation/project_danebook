Redirect signed-in users automatically to their newsfeed instead of the home page

Display a chronological listing of posts from the current user's friends

Allow liking/commenting on all these posts

Allow posting directly atop the newsfeed (like in the timeline)

You can only view your own newsfeed

Send a welcome email upon signup in both HTML and Plaintext form

As a user who just had something commented on
I want to receive a notification email
So I can immediately respond


An email is sent only when someone else comments on your photos or posts

The email is both HTML and plaintext

The email uses asynchronous/background processing so it doesn't block your server

# Highlights a potential bug where a nested resource could have the same ID as the current user causing the logical expression `params[:id] == current_user.id.to_s` to be true and not redirecting when it should

# user/:user_id/posts/:id/update
# user_id == 1
# post.id == 1


# HAS BUG
def require_current_user
  unless params[:id] == current_user.id.to_s || params[:user_id] == current_user.id.to_s
    # redirect here
  end
end


# Fixes bug
def require_current_user
  user_id_key = controller_name == 'users' ? :id : :user_id
  unless params[user_id_key] == current_user.id.to_s
    #
  end
end
