# Prototyping Additional Danebook Pages

This pair project concludes Week 1 of the [Viking Code School](http://vikingcodeschool.com)

### Your Task

The project is created using an Agile Development approach and managed with [a Pivotal Tracker project](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/1149270).  You will complete it by pair programming with your partner, making sure to switch off every 25 minutes (determined by a [pomodoro timer](http://tomato-timer.com/).

#### Getting Started

2. Check out the [Pivotal Tracker Project](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/s/projects/1149270) to see the stories for this project.  The Acceptance Criteria for each story is listed in the Tasks field.  The mockups are included as comments on their respective Epics (you might need to click the "Epics" tab to display them). Familiarize yourself with what you'll be building.
1. Each partner should [fork this repository](https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo) to make a copy and then clone their fork locally.
2. Each partner should [add a remote](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-a-remote) to their local clone called "pair" which points to their partner's fork (e.g. `$ git remote add pair https://github.com/partner_username/repo_name.git`).  This is how you'll pass changes between each other when it's time to switch roles.

#### Diving In

You will produce the desired pages using your understanding of HTML, CSS, SASS and Bootstrap.

1. Choose the first driver and start screen sharing.  For starters, add a link to each partner's Github repo to this README on the first driver's machine.
2. Begin working through the stories on the first driver's machine.  Start the [pomodoro timer](http://tomato-timer.com) for 25 minutes.
2. Commit often -- do it whenever some useful piece of markup is finished.
2. When the pomodoro interval is up, commit all current changes and then push them up to Github.  
3. The new driver should update their repo from their partner's fork using the remote you set up already -- `$ git pull pair`.

#### Finishing Up

Once you've completed all the stories and pages, you will need to submit your work back to the main repository and perform code review.

4. When all stories are complete, the last driver should push their copy to their fork as normal.  The last navigator should update their repository as if he/she was about to switch roles and then push these changes to his/her fork.  Now both partners should have current forks.
4. **Each partner** should submit their fork as a separate pull request back to [the main upstream repository](https://github.com/vikingeducation/danebook_pages).  
3. After submitting your pull request, you will perform a code review on your assigned partner for the upcoming week.  As before, identify that person's pull request on the Pull Requests tab and reviewing the files it contains.  
4. Submit your review as [comments to the pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests#pull-request-discussion).
