Danebook
========

Danebook is a Facebook clone at the micro-community level. It mimics the basic functionality of a social network and was designed for educational purposes to learn how to build a social network of my own from scratch. It was tested through model and integration testing using RSpec. Some of the core functionality involves working with forms, polymorphic and self-associations, user authentication, and databases. Building Danebook was a project included as part of Viking Code School's curriculum.
